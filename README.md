# SimpleBlockChain
An extremely simple BlockChain implementation in C++

Compile using `g++ -o test main.cpp sha256.cpp block.cpp block.h sha256.h`

A difficulty of 5 seems best for most systems to receive a blockrate that isn't too fast but doesn't take all day. Playing around with this really helps you see how difficulty grows exponentially.
